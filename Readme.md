# Android APK Archive

Use these .APK files to sideload the Overkill Solar Mobile app on a device that isn't supported by the Google Play store.    
For example, Amazon fire tablets can run the app but they don't have the google play store.
We tried to submit to the Amazon App Store but gave up because the standard Android operating system requires location permission to make bluetooth discovery work, but Fire tablets don't have GPS location, so requiring this permission makes the app technically invalid per Amazon's approval criteria.     
This is frustrating because the app works fine when you get it sideloaded.

Not all devices are compatible with the app.     
It should work all the way back to Android 6.0, but there is so much variation in Android devices and versions that its impossible to tell without trying it.
